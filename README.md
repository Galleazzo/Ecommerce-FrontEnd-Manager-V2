# Angular Ecommerce Dashboard Project

üöÄ Welcome to my Angular Ecommerce Dashboard project! üõçÔ∏è

## Overview

This project is an Angular-based dashboard for an ecommerce application, with the backend implemented in Java. The design template for the frontend is sourced from [Youpez Admin](https://github.com/petter-ka/youpez-admin). The Angular version used in this project is 11.

## Purpose

This project is primarily for personal learning and exploration of Angular, Java, and ecommerce dashboard development. While it can be utilized for academic purposes, it is not intended for production use. If you choose to use it for non-commercial projects, kindly give credit to both myself (Paulo Antonio Galleazzo de Lima) and the owner of the frontend template.
